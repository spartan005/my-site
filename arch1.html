		<h4>In Architecture &#8544; we went from making paper sketches to google Sketch-Up 3D models</h4>
		<p>The project was to create a two bedroom house under 1400 sq feet (not including the garage and porches). We started by making many simple bubble sketches, then moved on to more detailed preliminary sketches. After the sketches were approved by
		the teacher we made our house and a roof for the house on graph paper and then combined the two into a large graph. When we finished the large graph we finally got to create our house in 3d using google Sketch-Up. </p>
